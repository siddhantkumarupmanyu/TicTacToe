Input(players: List[Players]) calls moveEvent on all players it has, appropriate one will forward it
    - Not exactly like that....
    - I guess they will be more like ConsoleInput..
    - I can abstract the idea used in ConsoleInput.. and extend classes from it


---------
i guess it's players responsibility to only forward moveEvent if it's his move,
and not play's to check every time if the move comes from right player,
but it assumes it comes from right player (player that actually have turn in play class)


---------
coroutines did not improved AiPlayer performance.
-using ThreadPoolExecutor

No gain in performance instead flashy values are returned


---------
thing to note
values returned by running getGoodValue are mostly all same,
why even i am running for all children,
just compare two and if they are equal go for third,
and then compare...

---------

refactor board class to take tuple instead of x, y

---------
Additional features

total games played -> game class

how many won etc.. -> player class
